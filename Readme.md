# How to add the capability to insert comments to XtraGrid cells (like in MS Excel)


<p>In this example, the following functionality is implemented:<br />
1. It is possible to insert a comment to an XtraGrid cell via the context menu item. This comment is stored in a separate storage (Dictionary).<br />
2. It is possible to edit a comment via the context menu item.<br />
3. When a cell has a comment, a triangle is drawn in the top right corner of this cell.<br />
4. When the user moves the mouse pointer to a cell with a comment, a hint with the text of this comment is shown.</p>
